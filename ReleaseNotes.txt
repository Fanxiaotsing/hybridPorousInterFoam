V1.0 (2019-10) ===> First release of the toolbox 

## Solvers 

- hybridMultiphaseFoam

     - A new, real multi-scale solver for multiphase flow in porous media

## Tutorials

- Darcy Flow Cases 

    - Test cases regarding the verification of the solver in a domain
      completely occupied by porous media (Buckley-Leverett and
      determination of a capillarity-gravity equilibirum)  

- Free Flow Cases
    
     - Test cases regarding the verification of the same solver in a
       domain where there is no porous media or just a porous media 
       boundary (capillary-driven flows, contact angle implementations, 
       Bretherton thin film-dynamics)

- Example Applications
	
     - Sample cases that show the multi-scale nature of this solver by
       simulating systems with a combination of porous and free-fluid
       regions (fractures, coastal barriers, drainage, imbibition,
       porous fluid reservoir).     

## Libraries

- porousInterfaceProperties

     - addition of a constant contact angle interface condition at the porous media-fluid interface. 

- porousImmicscibleIncompressibleTwoPhaseMixture

     - addition of an immicisble incompressible two-phase fluid class that allows for the use of
       porousInterfaceProperties

- porousTwoPhaseProperties

     - defenition of two-phase fluid properties that allows for the use of
       porousInterfaceProperties
